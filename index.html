        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Aspiring iOS Developer | Computer Programming and Analysis Student <br>
            <br>
            My name is William Cham, and I was raised in Panama City, Panama.
            I am currently pursuing a diploma in Computer Programming and Analysis at George Brown College while 
            working in the mobile department at Best Buy, where I assist customers with technology solutions and mobile activations.<br>
            <br> 
            I thrive on the process of designing and developing software that makes a difference. My primary focus is 
            on mobile app development, with a specialization in iOS development, which aligns perfectly with my goal of 
            creating impactful applications.<br>
            <br>
            Besides my technical skills in programming, I value communication and building relationships. 
            My ability to connect with diverse groups of people is supported by my proficiency in languages. 
            I am fluent in two languages and have working knowledge of three more. This multilingual capability allows me to 
            collaborate effectively across cultures.
            I am eager to continue honing my skills and using technology to create solutions that inspire and help others.
